            <p>The Surya Kriya is an ancient classical hatha yoga practise, considered to be the original form from which the more popular Sun Salutation or Surya Namaskar is derived. This is a sequence of steps involving postures and breath and practised in cycles, that provides a great way to stabilise the human system as a preparation for elevating consciousness. In addition to strengthening the back muscles and invigorating the body, it also improves mental focus, and balances hormonal levels. </p>
            <p>&ldquo;Surya&rdquo; means &ldquo;Sun,&rdquo; and &ldquo;kriya&ldquo; means &ldquo;inner energy process.&rdquo; Surya Kriya activates the solar plexus within the system and balances a person&#39;s energies, leading to stability of the body and stillness of the mind. This strong foundation becomes the basis to explore higher dimensions of life.</p>
            <p>Traditionally available only to select groups of yogis, Surya Kriya is being offered by Sadhguru as a comprehensive spiritual practice that is ideal for the hectic pace of today&#39;s world.</p>
