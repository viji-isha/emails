            <p class="highlight">Dear {{{{raw}}}}{{FIRST_NAME}}{{{{/raw}}}},</p>
            <p>
                The time is rapidly approaching where we will be celebrating the second International Day of Yoga (IDY) this year!
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadhguru's vision is to make the IDY into a great offering of yoga, and a possibility for every single human
                being to experience meditativeness, expanding his/her perception of life from individuality to universality.
                Building on last year's success, we are hoping to take another great step in offering an authentic spiritual
                process for all those who seek it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wish to invite you to take part in bringing this vision to life by contributing in the various activities
                planned ahead.
            </p>
            <p>
                We need support in organizing sessions - from setting up our venues, to conducting sessions,
                manning counters, ushering participants - we need a lot of hands to make them happen in the biggest way possible!
                If you are able to offer support in any capacity, please
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1zcdoZGyBDLqfd71KvzKYNcSHkrt6L6JVpRv29hkaEsA/viewform">click here</a>
                to register as a volunteer.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you would like to organize a Isha Upa Yoga session at your workplace/school/organization,
                please let us know and we can organize a session there.
            </p>
            <p>
                With enough focus, from enough volunteers, together we can make the IDY reach to as many people as possible,
                helping realise Sadhguru's vision of offering one drop of spirituality to every individual on the planet.
