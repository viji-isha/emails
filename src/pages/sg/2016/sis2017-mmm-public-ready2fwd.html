                About Sadhguru
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
                Sadhguru is a realized yogi, mystic and visionary who has dedicated himself to the elevation of the physical, mental, and spiritual well-being of all people. He is an author and opinion maker who is regularly invited to speak at leading international forums. He has spoken at many prestigious global conferences such as World Peace Summit at the United Nations and the World Economic Forum.
            </p>
            <p class="justify">
                Sadhguru is often described as a contemporary spiritual leader, since he belongs to no particular tradition and incorporates aspects of yogic sciences that are most relevant for modern-day life into his teachings and practices. His scientific methods for self-transformation have universal appeal. Sadhguru's insights into the mechanisms of life are an outcome of his profound experience of the Self, and serve as a guide to exploring the deeper dimensions of life. His life and work serve as reminders that the inner science of yoga is not esoteric philosophy from an outdated past, but is absolutely relevant and applicable to our lives today.
